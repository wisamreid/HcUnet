# Hair Cell Unet (HcUnet)
###### A library of deep learning functions for analysis of confocal z-stacks of mouse cochlear hair cells written in pytorch.

### Quickstart Guide
Bare minimum code requirement for evaluation of an image. 
```python
from unet import unet_constructor as Unet
import torch.nn as nn
import dataloader
import transforms as t


data = dataloader.stack(path='./Data',
                        joint_transforms=[t.to_float(), t.reshape()],
                        image_transforms=[t.normalize()],
                        )

model = Unet(conv_functions=(nn.Conv3d, nn.ConvTranspose3d, nn.MaxPool3d, nn.BatchNorm3d),
             in_channels=4,
             out_channels=1,
             feature_sizes=[8,16,32,64,128],
             kernel={'conv1': (3, 3, 2), 'conv2': (3, 3, 1)},
             upsample_kernel=(2, 2, 2),
             max_pool_kernel=(2, 2, 1),
             upsample_stride=(2, 2, 1),
             dilation=1,
             groups=1).to('cpu')



image, mask, pwl = data[0]

out = model.forward(image.float())
```




## **unet.py**

### _class_ **unet_constructor**
```python
model = unet_constructor(conv_functions=(nn.Conv2d, nn.ConvTranspose2d, nn.MaxPool2d, nn.BatchNorm3d),
                         in_channels=3,
                         out_channels=2,
                         feature_sizes=[32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024],
                         kernel=(3, 3),
                         upsample_kernel=(2, 2),
                         max_pool_kernel=(2, 2),
                         upsample_stride=(2, 2),
                         dilation=1,
                         groups=1,
                        )
```
con_functions: A length 4 tuple of torch.nn functions in order of (nn.Conv(2/3)d, nn.ConvTranspose(2/3)d, nn.MaxPool(2/3)d, nn.BatchNorm(2/3)d) where each function is its 2d or 3d equivalent.
in_channels: Number of color channels the input image has 
out_channels: Number of output features (including background)
feature_sizes: list of integers representing the feature sizes at each step of the Unet. Each feature size must be twice the size of the previous. 
kernel: tuple of size 2 (or 3 for 3d) representing the kernel sizes of the convolution operations of Unet
upsample_kernel: tuple of size 2 (or 3 for 3d) representing the kernel sizes of the transpose convolutions for unet.
max_pool_kernel: tuple of size 2 (or 3 for 3d) representing the kernel sizes of the maximum pooling operations of Unet
upsample_stride: tuple of size 2 (or 3 for 3d) representing the stride of the transpose convolutions for unet. If an int is passed, it is automatically inferred that the stride is identical for all cardinal directions. i.e. upsample_stride=2 is the same as upample_stride=(2,2)
dilation: dialation of the transpose convolution kernels
groups: Number of groups of filters to be learned. Must be divisible by the number of input channels
#### _fun_ **forward**
```python
model.forward(image: torch.Tensor(dtype=torch.float))
```
*image*: torch.Tensor of type _float_ with shape [B, C, X, Y, Z] 
* B: Batch Size
* C: Number of Channels as defined by variable _in_channels_
* X: Size of image in x dimension
* Y: Size of image in y dimension
* Z: Size of image in z dimension

*returns*: ouput mask of torch.Tensor of type _float_ with shape [B, M, X*, Y*, Z*]
* B: Batch Size
* M: Number of mask Channels as defined by variable _out_channels_
* X*: Size of mask in x dimension
* Y*: Size of mask in y dimension
* Z*: Size of mask in z dimension

In all cases X*, Y*, and Z* will be less than X, Y, and Z due to only valid convolutions being used in the forward pass. The output mask will contain gradients unless model.eval() is called first. 

#### _fun_ **save**
```python
model.save(filename: str)
```
*filename*: filename by which to serialize model state to

This function serializes the state of the model as well as initialization parameters. The save model can be loaded with model.load(filename)

#### _fun_ **load**
```python
model.load(filename: str, to_cuda=True)
```
*filename* Filename which to load model from. 
*to_cuda* If true attemts to load the model state to cuda. If cuda is not available will throw a warning and initalize on the cpu instead.
