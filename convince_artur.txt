Biggest Issue: Segmentation is poopy...

Compare manual vs actual on unseen data....

Compare manual vs prediced but dialate the crap out of it to purposely include junk data to see how bad, in theory it could get.

Compare automatic vs fiji thresholding to see if there is a difference...

Compare with max projection, mean projection, etc...

Compare filtered vs unfiltered to smooth distributions...

Look at MYO7A, which shouldnt varry between promoters

Compare values of extreemly dialated vs super high on the probability map, where we are very confident there are cells. 50% confident vs 90% confident.
